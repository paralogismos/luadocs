## Installing `luadocs`
Clone the repository and navigate to the top directory.

### Default Installation
To install `luadocs` in the `/usr/local/bin` directory, just do:

```none
./configure
make install
```

Some users may need to run `sudo make` instead of `make` to gain write permissions for the default directory.

The `make` and `make all` commands have the same effect.

### Installation in a Custom Location

Run `./configure --help` to see configuration options.

The `--exec_prefix` option sets the prefix for executable directories. To install `luadocs` in the user's home `bin` directory do:

```none
./configure --exec_prefix=~
make install
```

Alternatively the `--bindir` option can be used to directly set the user executable directory:

```none
./configure --bindir=~/bin
make install
```

### Removing `luadocs`
`luadocs` can be removed by navigating back to the top directory of the repository and running `make uninstall`, or possibly `sudo make uninstall`.

Use `make distclean` to remove the `Makefile` and `config.status` files generated by the `configure` script.

> [!NOTE]
> After `luadocs` has been installed, running `make distclean` cancels the ability to remove `crun` by calling `make uninstall`. In this event the `luadocs` executable must be deleted manually.
